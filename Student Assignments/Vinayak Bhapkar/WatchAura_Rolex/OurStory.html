            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p id="p1">
                Rolex is a Swiss watch designer and manufacturer based in Geneva, Switzerland.[3] Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915.[4][5][6][7] After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for clock or watch); it later became Rolex SA.[3][5][8][9] Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.[6][10][11]

                Rolex SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, make, distribute, and service wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands. In 2023 Rolex agreed to acquire its longtime retail partner Bucherer.[
            </p>
            <p id="p2">Rolex is an integrated and independent Swiss watch manufacture. Headquartered in Geneva, it is recognized for its expertise and the quality of its products.

                Hans Wilsdorf, founder of the company, instilled a notion of perpetual excellence, leading to major watchmaking innovations, such as the Oyster, the first waterproof wristwatch and the Perpetual rotor self-winding mechanism. The brand designs, develops and produces the majority of its watch components in-house. Rolex also supports the arts and culture, sport, exploration, and those who are devising solutions to preserve the planet. It is a committed and responsible company whose products are made to last. In its quest for excellence, Rolex strives each day to improve not only its watches but also its environmental performance and its impact on society.

            <h1>Customer Service Is Our Main Mission</h1>
            <p>"Unlike many companies in search of maximizing a profit, our primary goal at Bob’s Watches is to create a trusted source to buy and sell pre-owned Rolex watches. Ensuring a positive experience for you is our primary mission. Located in Newport Beach, CA, we are the largest and most trusted source to buy or sell a Rolex." - Paul Altieri
                All of our certified, authentic Rolex watches have been carefully serviced and restored to mint condition. And while our business has grown rapidly over the past years, we hold strong to our commitment of offering the highest quality customer service. Bob’s Watches is accredited by the Better Business Bureau with an A+ rating.
            </p>
            <h1>Mission Statement & Service Culture</h1>
            <p>
                Admired but not easily replicated, Bob’s is firmly grounded in our founding principles – in who we are and what our mission is. Our goals and principles are guided by our devotion to creating the most trusted name in Pre-owned Rolex watches. Bob’s Watches has two locations in Naples, Florida ( Headquarters ) and Newport Beach, California. The Company has built its reputation over the years as being the "Kelly Blue" book for used Rolex prices. To date, Bob's is the only company that lists both the buy and sell price for every model so consumers can rest assured they are getting the best prices. Dealers, collectors, and consumers use its published "Rolex pricing guide" to obtain accurate values. The market now changes much more frequently as global supply and demand forces move markets similar to the stock exchange. With Bob's, its always been about honesty through transparent pricing.
