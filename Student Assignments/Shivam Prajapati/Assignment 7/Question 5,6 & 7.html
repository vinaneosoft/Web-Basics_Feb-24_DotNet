<h1>Tiger</h1>

<div class="contianer" id="box1">
 <p> Tiger is the national animal of India. It is a wild animal found in places of West Bengal, Assam, central India, etc. In my favourite animal tiger essay, some characteristics of the tiger are discussed.

 </p>
<p>
  A short paragraph on tiger: The tiger is considered a sacred animal in India. It is present in numerous Indian folklores and is associated with Indian goddesses such as the goddess Durga. The tiger is a symbol of power, bravery and might. 
</p>

<p>
  The tiger is a carnivore and it preys on animals such as deer, bullocks, antelopes, etc. the female tiger is called the “tigress” and the offspring is the “cub”. Tigers live in “lairs”. They communicate with each other through roars and are recluse animals. Tigers are very kind to one another. However, humans kill tigers for their skin and nails and capture them in zoos away from the wildlife which makes them unhappy.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, from this short essay on tigers, it can be concluded that tigers are very important in maintaining the balance of the environment. They are a symbol of power and rage. However, they are endangered and should be protected from human cruelties.
