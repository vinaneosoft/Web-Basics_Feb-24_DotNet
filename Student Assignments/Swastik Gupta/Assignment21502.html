        <h2>Jadeja's100</h2>
        <p>Drinks are on the field now. Probably a shared first-hour that. England got a couple of early wickets but Jurel and Ashwin have looked solid at the crease so far. 
            Jadeja will be disappointed at having not added too many more to his overnight tally.</p>
          <p> batting on 99, tucked the ball to mid-on. He called for a run and then refused. Sarfaraz, wanting Jadeja to complete his hundred as much as his partner and the entire Indian team, committed, and by the time he realised that the all-rounder had pulled back, it was too late. Mark Wood got to the ball, picked it up and smashed the stumps at the non-striker end with a fierce direct hit.

            Having said that, Sarfaraz opted to dwell on
            the positives rather than the mix-up. The emotional reactions of his 
            father and wife, the rush of emotions when Anil Kumble presented him the cap, 
            facing that first ball, scoring that first run and to top it all, smashing a
             fifty on debut. As for the run out</p>
