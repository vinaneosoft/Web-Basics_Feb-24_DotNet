    <h1>Rohit Sharma</h1>
    <p>Take Rohit Sharma out of the equation and India'spure batters 
        have only 29 Tests - out of which 22
          belongs to Shubman Gill alone - between them going into the third
           Test against England at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot. 
        That is 11 less than Ollie Pope, one of England's
         least experienced players in their batting unit.</p>
