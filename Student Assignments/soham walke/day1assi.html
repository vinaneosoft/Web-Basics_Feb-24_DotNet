<!--How does the time tag work on HTML?
The <time> HTML element represents a specific period in time.
 It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.
 It may represent one of the following: A time on a 24-hour clock.-->

 <time datetime="2018-04-02">April 4</time>

<blockquote>
   <q> When people show loyalty to you, you take care of those who are with you</q>. It's how it goes with everything. If you have a small circle of friends, and one of those friends doesn't stay loyal to you, they don't stay your friend for very long.
