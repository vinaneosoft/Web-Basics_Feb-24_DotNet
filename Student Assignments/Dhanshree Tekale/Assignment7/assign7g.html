                Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen 
                between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including 
                brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for
                pollinators.[1] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent
                on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's 
                case, a source of food
