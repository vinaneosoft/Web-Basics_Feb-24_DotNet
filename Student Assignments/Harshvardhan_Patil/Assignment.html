Tendulkar is the leading century maker in both Test and ODI and has so far scored 99 (51 Test + 48 ODI) international centuries. He also has played highest number of Test and ODI matches. Among many laurels he had won - the most prominent ones are: Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, India's highest sporting honour.
