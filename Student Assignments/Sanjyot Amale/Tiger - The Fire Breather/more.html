        <h2>White Tiger</h2>
        <p>"White tiger" typically refers to a rare variant of the Bengal tiger
          (Panthera tigris tigris), which is a subspecies of tiger native to the
          Indian subcontinent. The term "white tiger" specifically refers to individuals
          that exhibit a rare genetic condition known as leucism, which reduces the pigment
          in their fur, resulting in a predominantly white coat with black or dark brown stripes.
          White tigers are not albinos, as they still retain some pigment in their eyes and stripes.
        </p>
        <p> Due to their striking appearance, white tigers have been popular attractions in zoos and wildlife
          sanctuaries. However, their rarity in the wild is largely due to the fact that the genetic mutation
          responsible for their white coat color is relatively rare in wild tiger populations.
        </p>
        <p> It's important to note that while white tigers may appear captivating, their existence is often linked to
          issues such as inbreeding, as many are bred in captivity to maintain the trait. Additionally, conservation
          efforts primarily focus on preserving wild tiger populations and their natural habitats.

        <h2>Siberian Tiger</h2>
        <p>The Siberian tiger, also known as the Amur tiger, is the largest subspecies of tiger, native to the forests
          of eastern Russia. They inhabit the Sikhote-Alin mountain range and the Amur River basin, with small
          populations found in northeastern China and possibly North Korea</p>
        <p>Characterized by their immense size, Siberian tigers weigh between 400 to 675 pounds for males and 220 to 370
          pounds for females. Their thick, golden fur helps them withstand the cold climate of their habitat. These apex
          predators primarily hunt large ungulates like deer and wild boar.</p>
        <p>Despite their size and strength, Siberian tigers face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and illegal trade.
          Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and anti-poaching measures, are vital for their survival.
          Preserving the Siberian tiger is crucial for maintaining the ecological balance of their forest ecosystems.

      <div class="section-content">
        <h2>Indochinese Tiger</h2>
        <p>The Indochinese tiger, also known as the Corbett's tiger, is a tiger subspecies native to Southeast Asia,
          particularly found in countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. They inhabit a variety
          of habitats including tropical forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.
        <p>Similar to other tiger subspecies, the Indochinese tiger is characterized by its distinctive orange coat with
          black stripes, which provides camouflage in its natural environment. They are slightly smaller than some other
          tiger subspecies, with males typically weighing between 330 to 430 pounds (150 to 195 kg) and females weighing
          between 220 to 290 pounds (100 to 130 kg).</p>
        </p>
        <p>Indochinese tigers primarily prey on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, and other ungulates. However,
          their habitat is increasingly fragmented due to deforestation, agricultural expansion, and human encroachment,
          leading to habitat loss and degradation. Poaching for their body parts and illegal wildlife trade also pose
          significant threats to their survival.</p>

        <h2>Malayan Tiger</h2>
        <p>The Malayan tiger, also known as the Panthera tigris jacksoni, is a subspecies of tiger native to the Malay
          Peninsula and parts of southern Thailand. Recognized for its distinctive appearance and behaviors, the Malayan
          tiger serves as a symbol of biodiversity and national pride in Malaysia</p>
        <p>Physically, the Malayan tiger shares many characteristics with other tiger subspecies, featuring a striking
          orange coat adorned with dark stripes for camouflage. It typically measures around 8 to 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7
          meters) in length and weighs between 220 to 330 pounds (100 to 150 kilograms) for males, and slightly smaller
          for females.</p>
        <p>The Malayan tiger predominantly inhabits tropical and subtropical forests, where it preys on various mammals
          such as deer, wild boar, and sun bears. However, like many tiger populations worldwide, the Malayan tiger
          faces significant threats to its survival, primarily stemming from habitat loss due to deforestation, human
          encroachment, and illegal logging. Additionally, poaching for tiger parts and retaliatory killings further
          exacerbate the decline in their numbers.</p>

        <h2>South China Tiger</h2>
        <p>The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger or Panthera tigris amoyensis, is a subspecies of tiger
          native to southern China. It is one of the smaller tiger subspecies, with males typically weighing between 330
          to 440 pounds (150 to 200 kilograms) and females weighing slightly less.</p>
        <p>Historically, the South China tiger was widespread throughout the forests and grasslands of southern China.
          However, due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting, the population has dramatically declined, and it is
          now considered one of the rarest tiger subspecies in the world.</p>
        <p>Conservation efforts aimed at saving the South China tiger include captive breeding programs and habitat
          restoration initiatives. These efforts are critical for preserving genetic diversity and potentially
          reintroducing the species into suitable habitats in the future. Despite these efforts, the South China tiger
          remains on the brink of extinction, highlighting the urgent need for continued conservation actions to prevent
          its disappearance from the wild. </p>

      <div class="section-content">
        <h2>Sumatran Tiger</h2>
        <p>The Sumatran tiger, scientifically known as Panthera tigris sumatrae, is a critically endangered subspecies
          of tiger native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Renowned for its distinctive appearance and cultural
          significance, the Sumatran tiger holds a vital ecological role as a top predator in its tropical forest
          habitat.</p>
        <p>Characterized by its dark orange coat and thick black stripes, the Sumatran tiger is the smallest surviving
          tiger subspecies, with males typically weighing between 220 to 310 pounds (100 to 140 kilograms) and females
          weighing slightly less. Their smaller size is an adaptation to the dense forests they inhabit, allowing for
          enhanced agility and maneuverability.</p>
        <p>The Sumatran tiger primarily preys on various mammals, including deer, wild boar, and primates, playing a
          crucial role in regulating prey populations and maintaining ecosystem balance. However, like many tiger
          populations worldwide, the Sumatran tiger faces severe threats to its survival, primarily due to habitat loss
          and fragmentation caused by deforestation, agricultural expansion, and human encroachment.</p>

      <h1>3 Extinct Species of Tigers</h1>

      <p>Unfortunately, you won’t have the opportunity to see three extinct tiger species. These include the Caspian
        tiger
        (Panthera tigris virgata), the Bali tiger (Pantera tigris balica) and the Javan tiger (Panthera tigris
        sondaica).
        These subspecies of tigers have not been spotted in decades and none are known to be in captivity.</p><br>

      <p>Habitat loss and illegal poaching led to the extinction of these three tiger subspecies and continue to plague
        all tiger species that remain. If these threats aren’t stopped, the remaining tiger subspecies may also become
        extinct.</p>
      <div class="section-container">
        <div class="section-content">
          <h2>1. CASPIAN TIGER</h2>
          <p>The Caspian tiger was a large, powerful tiger that lived around the Caspian Sea. Its colors were muted. So
            much so, in fact, the Caspian tiger was sometimes referred to as the “gray tiger”. However, surviving pelts
            have rusty orange fur with quite a bit of brown. Perhaps the gray was a mutation such as that which created
            the white tiger or the blue tiger.

          <h2>2. BALI TIGER</h2>
          <p>The Bali tiger, another native of the Indonesian islands, was once the world’s smallest tiger. The male
            weighed between 200 and 220 pounds and the female, between143 and 176 pounds. It hasn’t been seen since the
            1930s. The only remains of the Bali tiger are bones and skulls which have been preserved in museums.

          <h2>3. JAVAN TIGER</h2>
          <p>The Javan tiger was the last of the three tigers that lived in Indonesia, along with the Bali tiger and the
            Sumatran tiger. The Javan tiger was slightly larger than the Bali. Although it has been listed as extinct
            since the 1970s, there are still periodic tiger sightings in the area which could be Javan.
