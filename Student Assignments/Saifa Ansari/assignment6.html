        <h2>Charles Darwin</h2>
        <p>Charles Darwin (1809 - 1882) was an English Natural scientist who laid down a framework for the theory of
            evolution - showing how Man evolved from lower life forms. At the time, his research and publication led to
            bitter controversy, but his theory of evolution and natural selection later became accepted within the
            scientific community.

            Charles Darwin was born on 12 February 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He was born into a wealthy and
            influential family. His grandfathers included - China manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, and Erasmus Darwin, one
            of the leading intellectuals of 18th century England.

            Darwin planned to study medicine at Edinburgh University, but later, at the instigation of his father,
            changed to studying Divinity at Christ's College, Cambridge University. Darwin was not a great student,
            preferring to spend time in outdoor pursuits; he spent a lot of time examining natural science and beetle
            collecting. After gaining a passionate interest in natural science, Darwin was offered a place on the HMS
            Beagle to act as a natural scientist on a voyage to the coast of South America.

            At the time, religion was a powerful force in society, and most people took the Bible as the infallible,
            literal word of God. This included the belief that God created the world in seven days, and the world was
            only a few thousand years old. However, on the voyage, Darwin increasingly began to see evidence of life
            being much older. In particular Lyell's 'Principles of Geology' suggested that fossils were evidence of
            animals living hundreds of thousands of years ago.

            On the voyage, Darwin made copious notes about specimens he found on his voyages. In particular, at the
            Galapagos Islands 500 miles west of South America, Darwin was struck by how the Finch was different on each
            individual island. He noticed that the Finch had somehow adapted to the various aspects of the particular
            island.

            Over the next 20 years, Darwin worked on the dilemma of how species evolve and can end up being quite
            different on different islands. Influenced by the work of Thomas Malthus, Darwin came up with a theory of
            natural selection and gradual evolution over time.

            “In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in
            adapting themselves best to their environment.”

            - Charles Darwin

            Darwin continued to refine his theory, and would intensively breed plants to work on his theories. However,
            realising how controversial his ideas were, Darwin delayed publishing them. It was not until learning that
            another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace had developed similar ideas, that Darwin was galvanised into
            publishing his own book.

            In 1859, the ground-breaking 'On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection' was published. It
            immediately gained widespread interest and attention, leading to intense debate about the contention that
            man - by implication was descended from animals like the ape.

            “Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be
            in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relationship to other
            organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally
            be inherited by its offspring.”



            - Charles Darwin, Origin of Species (1859)</p>

            

            However, by the time he died on 19 April 1882, his ideas had increasingly become accepted - at least by the
            scientific and non-religious society. He was given a state burial at Westminster Abbey.

            Darwin's Religious Beliefs
            Darwin was brought up in the Church of England, and at one point was being trained to be an Anglican priest.
            Like many of his generation, he took the Bible as the literal word of God and often quoted it as a source of
            moral authority. However, after his epic voyage to South America, he became doubtful of the Bible as a
            source of history; he also felt no reason why all religions couldn’t be true.

            From 1849, he stopped going to church, though he never considered himself to be an atheist. He felt that
            'agnostic' suited his beliefs more closely. He wrote in his autobiography that he eventually gave up
            Christianity as he disagreed with the conclusion that all non-believers spend eternity in hell.

            “I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of
            the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost
            all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.”

            He was politically liberal, being an opponent of slavery. He experienced the brutality of how people treated
            their slaves in a Spanish colony.

            “I have watched how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery.
            What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it!”</p>

            Facts about Charles Darwin
            He was the grandson of Josiah Wedgwood the famous furniture manufacturer.
            He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh but found lectures dull.
            He learned taxidermy from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave.
            Darwin became an enthusiastic Beetle collector - which was a craze at the time.
            His father sent him to Christ's College, Cambridge with the intention of training him as an Anglican parson.
            He later gave up Christianity.
            His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist and popular writer. His
            observations would be used to develop his theory of evolution.
            He sometimes questioned his own scientific discoveries. 'I feel most deeply that this whole question of
            creation is too profound for human intellect.''
            In modified form, Darwin's theory of evolution is now seen as the unifying theory of the life sciences.
            On the new Galápagos Islands Darwin saw many samples of animals which showed relations to animals in other
            parts of the world, e.g. Mockingbirds in Chile.
            During the Beagle expedition, Darwin shipped home a total of 1,529 species preserved in spirit and 3,907
            labelled dried specimens.
            Darwin and Wallace's theories on evolution were both presented on the same day in 1858 to the Linnean
            Society of London.
            Darwin took 22 years from the end of the voyage to publish his findings - he was worried about the reaction
            of people. It is said the thought of Wallace publishing first, galvanised him into action
            The full title of Origin of Species is On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection, or the
            Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.
            Darwin did not coin the phrase 'survival of the fittest'. It was added to the fifth edition of Origin of
            Species. The phrase came from economist Herbert Spencer.
            Darwin has appeared on more UK stamps than anyone outside the Royal Family.
            Seven months after the publication of 'Origin of Species' the famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate occurred
            between Thomas Henry Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. The debate is considered to be a great moment in
            natural history - and a key moment in the acceptance of evolution.
        </p>
        <p>Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, The Mount.[22][23] He
            was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née
            Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus
            Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy
            of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.[24]

            plants

            Both families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a
            freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but
            Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles
            already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in
            1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the
            nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.[25]

            Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire,
            before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October
            1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies.[26] He learned
            taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had
            accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.[27]

            In Darwin's second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group
            featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox
            religious concepts of science.[28] He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life
            cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own
            discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised
            Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas
            in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.[29] Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history
            course, which covered geology—including the debate between Neptunism and Plutonism. He learned the
            classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the
            largest museums in Europe at the time.[30]

            Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ's College, Cambridge, in
            January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country
            parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge's Tripos exams, and was required instead to join the ordinary
            degree course.[31] He preferred riding and shooting to studying.[32]

            Cambridge, where he had rooms.
            During the first few months of Darwin's enrolment at Christ's College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox
            was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology
            and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting He did this zealously, and had some of his finds
            published in James Francis Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology (1829-32).

            Through Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow. He met
            other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to
            these dons as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his
            studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley's Evidences of Christianity (1795).
            In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the
            ordinary degree.

            Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the
            Existence and Attributes of the Deity (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in
            nature, explaining adaptation as God acting through laws of nature.[39] He read John Herschel's new book,
            Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), which described the highest aim of natural
            philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and Alexander von
            Humboldt's Personal Narrative of scientific travels in 1799-1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to
            contribute, Darwin planned to visit Tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history
            in the tropics. In preparation, he joined Adam Sedgwick's geology course, then on 4 August travelled with
            him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in Wales</p>
