            <h2>Overwiew and description</h2> 
            <p>The carnation, Dianthus caryophyllus, is a member of the flowering plant family Caryophyllaceae, commonly called the pink family or the carnation family. This is a large family with 88 genera and some 2,000 species. Most are herbaceous annuals or perennials, dying off above ground each year. The leaves are almost always opposite, rarely whorled. The blades are entire, petiolate, and often stipulate. The hermaphroditic flowers are terminal, blooming singly or in branched or forked in cymes. The flowers are regular and mostly 5-merous, i.e. with 5 petals and 5 sepals, but sometimes with 4 petals. The petals are fringed or deeply cleft at the end.</p>

            <p>Within Caryophyllaceae, carnations belong to the Dianthus genus. Dianthus includes about 300 species of mostly perennial herbs, with a few annual or biennial, and some are low subshrubs with woody basal stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, and mostly linear. The flowers have five petals, typically with a frilled margin, and are (in almost all species) pale to dark pink. (One species, D. knappii, has yellow flowers with a purple center.)</p>

            <p>
                The carnation, Dianthus caryophyllus, is a herbaceous plant growing to 60 centimeters tall, or taller in some conditions. In the wild, it is an annual plant, but plant breeders have selected perennial forms. Thus, border carnations, which are cultivars and derivatives of D. caryophyllus, are perennial, with some cut-flower varieties grown for one to three years (DHA 2005). Carnation stems are woody at the base but have herbaceous branches (DHA 2005).
            </p>

            <p>Carnation leaves are glaucous grayish green to blue-green, slender, up to 15 centimeters long. The flowers of D. caryophyllus, the wild forms, are single and have five petals, and are generally white to pink to purple in color (DHA 2005). However, border carnations, the cultivated forms of D. caryophyllus, may have double flowers with as many as 40 petals (DHA 2005). Flowers of the wild carnations are about three to five centimeters diameter, but border carnations grown in gardens are typically six to eight-and-one-half centimeters in diameter and some greenhouse grown plants may have flowers up to ten centimeters in diameter (DHA 2005). Cultivars may be many colors, including red, white, yellow, and green.</p>

            <!-- <p>The carnation is probably native to the Mediterranean region but its exact range is unknown due to extensive cultivation for the last two millennium. Today, D. caryophyllus is not seen in the wild with the exception of some Mediterranean countries (DHA 2005). In the wild, carnations require insect pollinators, but most commercially important carnation varieties are sterile and are vegetatively propagated (DHA 2005).</p> -->

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The carnation's history dates back to ancient Greek and Roman times, when it was used in art and decor. Christians believe that the first carnation bloomed on earth when Mary wept for Jesus as he carried his cross. Carnations in these early times were predominantly found in shades of pale pink and peach, but over the years the palette of available colors has grown to include red, yellow, white, purple, and even green. Throughout so many centuries of change, the popularity of the carnation has remained undiminished. The fact that the carnation continues to endure is a testament to its vast appeal.</p>

            <p>In the era of ancient Rome, carnations held a profound symbolic meaning, representing love and affection, making them a cherished gift among the people. The flower's scientific designation, Dianthus, derives from the Greek terms "dios" signifying god and "anthos" meaning flower, reflecting the ancient belief in the carnation's sacredness and divine origins.</p>

            <p>During the Middle Ages, carnations gained popularity throughout Europe, becoming renowned for their diverse applications in herbal medicine. Esteemed for their perceived medicinal properties, these enchanting blooms were employed in treating various ailments such as indigestion and inflammation. Embrace the rich tapestry of history and therapeutic significance woven within the timeless petals of the carnation.</p>
