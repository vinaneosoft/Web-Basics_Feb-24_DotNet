        <h1> Stephen Hawking</h1>
        <div id="first" class="common">
            Stephen Hawking (1942 - 2018) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist and author. He is best known
            for his attempts to explain in clear terms the origins of the universe and some of the most complicated
            aspects of the cosmos and physics. Hawking was the first scientist to offer a theory of cosmology explained
            by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.
            Early life Stephen Hawking
            Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England. His family had moved to Oxford to
            escape the threat of V2 rockets over London. As a child, he showed prodigious talent and unorthodox study
            methods. On leaving school, he got a place at University College, Oxford University where he studied
            Physics. His physics tutor at Oxford, Robert Berman, later said that Stephen Hawking was an extraordinary
            student. He used few books and made no notes, but could work out theorems and solutions in a way other
            students couldn't.

            “My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at
            all.”

            Stephen Hawking's Universe (1985) by John Boslough, Ch. 7

            stephen hawkingOn gaining a B.A.Hons in Physics, he briefly stayed to study astronomy but was not interested
            in observing sunspots so moved to Trinity College, Cambridge where he was able to pursue his passion for
            theoretical astronomy and cosmology.

            It was in Cambridge that Stephen Hawking first started to develop symptoms of neuro-muscular problems – a
            type of motor neuron disease. This quickly started to hamper his physical movements. His speech became
            slurred, and he became unable to even to feed himself. At one stage, the doctors gave him a lifespan of
            three years. However, the progress of the disease slowed down, and he has managed to overcome his severe
            disability to continue his research and active public engagements. At Cambridge, a fellow scientist
            developed a synthetic speech device which enabled him to speak by using a touchpad. This early synthetic
            speech sound has become the ‘voice’ of Stephen Hawking, and as a result, he has kept the original sound of
            this early model – despite technological advancements.

            Nevertheless, despite the latest technology, it can still be a time-consuming process for him to
            communicate. Stephen Hawking has taken a pragmatic view to his disability:

            “It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on with life and I haven’t done
            badly. People won’t have time for you if you are always angry or complaining. ” The Guardian (27 September
            2005)
