    <q>With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's woundsâ€¦.</q> By Abraham Lincoln

    <blockquote>The Purple Cow
        By Gelett Burgess</blockquote>
    <pre>
        I never saw a purple cow,
        I never hope to see one,
        But I can tell you, anyhow,
        I'd rather see than be one!</pre>
