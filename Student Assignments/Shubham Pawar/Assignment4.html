    <h1>Ratan Tata</h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="para1">Ratan Tata (born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India) Indian businessman who became chairman
        (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate. 

        A member of a prominent family of Indian industrialists and philanthropists (see Tata family), 
        he was educated at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, where he earned a B.S. (1962) in architecture
        before returning to work in India. He gained experience in a number of Tata Group businesses and 
        was named director in charge (1971) of one of them, the National Radio and Electronics Co. 
        He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in 1991 succeeded his uncle, J.R.D. Tata, 
        as chairman of the Tata Group. <br><br>
        
        Upon assuming leadership of the conglomerate, Tata aggressively sought to expand it, and increasingly 
        he focused on globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired London-based Tetley Tea 
        for $431.3 million, and in 2004 it purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of 
        South Korea’s Daewoo Motors for $102 million. In 2007 Tata Steel completed the biggest corporate 
        takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant Anglo-Dutch steel manufacturer Corus Group 
        for $11.3 billion.</p>

        <p id="para">In the 1970s Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.[15][16] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.[17] Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.</p>
