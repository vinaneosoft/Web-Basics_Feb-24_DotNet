        <h2>Martin Luther</h2>
        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian
            minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights
            movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights
            activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United
            States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and
            other forms of legalized discrimination.

            King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil
            rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern
            Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in
            Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was
            one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech on the
            steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the
            1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil
            Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

            The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the
            methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with
            segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times. Federal
            Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of
            the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on
            his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter,
            which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]

            On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent
            resistance. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam
            War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's
            Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the
            Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a
            scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King's death was followed by
            national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the
            Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day
            was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the
            federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor,
            and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National
            Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.

            Early life and education
            Birth
            King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to
            Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams).[4][5][6] King had an older sister, Christine King Farris,
            and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel "A. D." King.[7] Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams,[8] was a
            minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893,[6] and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in
            the following year.[9] Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks.[6] King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James
            Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia,[5][6] and was of African-Irish descent.[10][11][12] As an
            adolescent, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school
            education,[13][14][15] and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry.[15] King Sr.
            and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.[16][17] Until Jennie's death in 1941,
            they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' Victorian house, where King was
            born.[18][16][17][19]

            Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church.[17] Senior pastor
            Williams died in the spring of 1931[17] and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife,
            he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand.[6][17][20] In 1934, the church sent King Sr.
            on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA).[21] He
            also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther.[21] In
            reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, "This Congress deplores and condemns as
            a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or
            unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the
            world."[22] On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his
            five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr.[21][23][16][a]</p>
